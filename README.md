# Project F - FPGA Development

Project F is a little oasis where you can quench your thirst for FPGA knowledge and find accessible, [open-source](LICENSE) designs to learn from and build on. Our projects include _FPGA Graphics_, _FPGA Maths_, and the _Verilog Library_.

The [Project F blog](https://projectf.io) features over fifty posts covering FPGAs, Verilog, and RISC-V.

## FPGA Graphics

In this series, we learn about graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. We'll learn how screens work, play Pong, create starfields and sprites, paint Michelangelo's David, draw lines and triangles, and animate characters and shapes. Along the way, you'll experience a range of designs and techniques, from memory and finite state machines to crossing clock domains and translating C algorithms into Verilog. I recently began adding Lattice ECP5 support to this series.

## Verilog Library

The Project F Library includes handy Verilog designs for everyone. From framebuffers and video output to division and square root, rom and ram, and even circle drawing. You can freely build on these [MIT licensed](../../LICENSE) designs.

Visit the [Library](lib/) for the Verilog designs or get an overview from the [Verilog Library blog post](https://projectf.io/verilog-lib/).

## Requirements

### FPGA Architecture

Our designs seek to be vendor-neutral, but some functionality requires support for vendor primitives. We currently support these FPGA architectures:

* **XC7** - Xilinx 7 Series FPGAs, such as Spartan-7 and Artix-7
  * `BUFG`, `MMCME2_BASE`, `OBUFDS`, `OSERDES2`
* **iCE40** - Lattice iCE40 FPGAs, such as iCE40 UltraPlus
  * `SB_IO`, `SB_PLL40_PAD`, `SB_SPRAM256KA`
* **ECP5** - Lattice ECP5 FPGAs, such as LFE5U-45
  * `EHXPLLL`, `ODDRX1F`

We also infer block ram (BRAM); see [lib/memory](lib/memory).

Porting to other architectures should be straightforward.

## SystemVerilog?

We use a few simple features of SystemVerilog to make Verilog more pleasant:

* `logic` type is safer and less work than using `wire` and `reg`
* `always_comb` and `always_ff` to make intent clear and catch mistakes
* `$clog2` to calculate vector widths (e.g. for addresses)
* `enum` to make finite state machines simpler to work with
* Matching names in module instances: `.clk_pix` instead of `.clk_pix(clk_pix)`

I believe these features are helpful, especially for beginners. All the SystemVerilog features are compatible with recent versions of Verilator, Yosys, Icarus Verilog, and Xilinx Vivado.
