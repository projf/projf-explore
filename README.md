# Exploring FPGAs with Project F

Project F brings FPGAs to life with exciting [open-source](LICENSE) designs you can build on.  
Learn more at [projectf.io](https://projectf.io/) and follow [@WillFlux](https://twitter.com/WillFlux) for updates.

## Verilog Library

The Library includes handy Verilog designs from across Project F.
From framebuffers and video output, to division and square root, rom and ram, and even drawing shapes.

See [Library](lib/) for details or learn about the [background to the Library](https://projectf.io/posts/verilog-library-announcement/).

## Graphics

In this series, we explore graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. If you're new to the
series, start by reading [FPGA Graphics](https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-graphics/).

## Hello

A three-part introduction to FPGA development with Verilog; currently available for two boards: the Arty A7 and Nexys Video.

* **Hello Arty**: [Designs](hello/hello-arty) - [Blog 1](https://projectf.io/posts/hello-arty-1/) - [Blog 2](https://projectf.io/posts/hello-arty-2/) - [Blog 3](https://projectf.io/posts/hello-arty-3/)

The third part will be available for the Nexys Video soon.

## Maths

Maths & Algorithms is our next topic. Stay tuned for this series in 2021.

## Requirements

### FPGA

Our designs seek to be vendor-neutral, but some functionality requires
support for vendor primitives. We currently support two FPGA architectures:

* **XC7** - Xilinx Series 7 FPGAs, such as Spartan-7 and Artix-7
* **iCE40** - Lattice iCE40 FPGAs, such as iCE40 UltraPlus

Porting to other architectures should be straightforward.

### SystemVerilog

We’ll use a few choice features from SystemVerilog to make Verilog a little more pleasant. If you’re familiar with Verilog, you’ll have no trouble. All the SystemVerilog features used are compatible with recent versions of Verilator, Yosys, and Xilinx Vivado
