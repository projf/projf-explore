# Project F: Exploring FPGAs

This repository contains the SystemVerilog designs to accompany the Project F [Exploring FPGAs](https://projectf.io/tags/explore/) series. The designs are open source hardware under the permissive [MIT licence](LICENSE), but the blog is subject to normal copyright restrictions.

## FPGA Graphics

In this series, we explore graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. We start by learning how displays work, before racing the beam with Pong, starfields and sprites, simulating life with bitmaps, drawing lines and triangles, and finally creating simple 3D models. I'll be writing and revising this series throughout 2020 and 2021.
