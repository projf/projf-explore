# Project F - FPGA Development

Project F is a little oasis where you can quench your thirst for FPGA knowledge, where you can find accessible, [open-source](LICENSE) designs to learn from and build on. Our main projects are the _Verilog Library_, _FPGA Graphics_ and _Maths and Algorithms_ tutorial series; read on to learn more.

> There's something profoundly satisfying about designing at the hardware level, be it creating your own arcade game, handling unusual hardware interfaces, building your own robot, creating art, analysing oodles of data, or even developing your own CPU. I find working with FPGAs gives me a sense of delight so often lacking in modern software development.

Get an introduction with [About Project F](https://projectf.io/about/), follow [@WillFlux](https://mastodon.social/@WillFlux) for updates, and join the FPGA discussion on [1BitSquared Discord](https://discord.gg/cf869yDbXf). Take a peek into the future with our [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## Verilog Library

The Project F Library includes handy Verilog designs for everyone. From framebuffers and video output to division and square root, rom and ram, and even circle drawing. You can freely build on these [MIT licensed](../../LICENSE) designs.

See [Library](lib/) for designs or get an overview from [Verilog Library blog](https://projectf.io/verilog-lib/).

## FPGA Graphics

In this series, we learn about graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. We'll learn how screens work, play Pong, create starfields and sprites, paint Michelangelo's David, draw lines and triangles, and animate characters and shapes. Along the way, you'll experience a range of designs and techniques, from memory and finite state machines to crossing clock domains and translating C algorithms into Verilog.

## Requirements

### FPGA Architecture

Our designs seek to be vendor-neutral, but some functionality requires
support for vendor primitives. We currently support two FPGA architectures with a third in testing:

* **XC7** - Xilinx 7 Series FPGAs, such as Spartan-7 and Artix-7
  * `BUFG`, `MMCME2_BASE`
  * HDMI support: `OBUFDS`, `OSERDES2`
* **iCE40** - Lattice iCE40 FPGAs, such as iCE40 UltraPlus
  * `SB_IO`, `SB_PLL40_PAD`, `SB_SPRAM256KA`
* **ECP5** - Lattice ECP5 is in testing with ULX3S board

We also infer block ram (BRAM), see [lib/memory](lib/memory).

Porting to other architectures should be straightforward.

## SystemVerilog?

We use a few simple features of SystemVerilog to make Verilog more pleasant:

* `logic` type is safer and less work than using `wire` and `reg`
* `always_comb` and `always_ff` to make intent clear and catch mistakes
* `$clog2` to calculate vector widths (e.g. for addresses)
* `enum` to make finite state machines simpler to work with
* Matching names in module instances: `.clk_pix` instead of `.clk_pix(clk_pix)`

I believe these features are helpful, especially for beginners. All the SystemVerilog features used are compatible with recent versions of Verilator, Yosys, and Xilinx Vivado. However, if you need to use an older Verilog standard, you can adapt these designs without too much trouble.
