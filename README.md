# Exploring FPGAs with Project F

Project F is a little oasis where you can quench your thirst for FPGA knowledge, where you can find accessible, [open-source](LICENSE) designs to learn from and enable your own projects. Our main projects are the _Verilog Library_ and _FPGA Graphics_ tutorial series; read on to learn more.

Get an introduction with [About Project F](https://projectf.io/about/), follow [@WillFlux](https://twitter.com/WillFlux) for updates, and join the FPGA discussion on [1BitSquared Discord](https://1bitsquared.com/pages/chat). Take a peek into the future with our [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## Verilog Library

The Project F Library includes handy Verilog designs for everyone. From framebuffers and video output, to division and square root, rom and ram, and even drawing shapes.

See [Library](lib/) for details or discover about the [background to the Library](https://projectf.io/posts/verilog-library-announcement/).

## Graphics

In this blog series, we explore graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. If you're new to the series, start by reading [FPGA Graphics](https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-graphics/).

## Hello

A three-part introduction to FPGA development with Verilog; currently available for two boards: the Arty A7 and Nexys Video.

* **Hello Arty**: [Designs](hello/hello-arty) - [Blog 1](https://projectf.io/posts/hello-arty-1/) - [Blog 2](https://projectf.io/posts/hello-arty-2/) - [Blog 3](https://projectf.io/posts/hello-arty-3/)

The third part will be available for the Nexys Video soon.

## Maths

Maths & Algorithms is our next topic. Stay tuned for this series in 2021.

## Requirements

### FPGA Architecture

Our designs seek to be vendor-neutral, but some functionality requires
support for vendor primitives. We currently support two FPGA architectures:

* **XC7** - Xilinx 7 Series FPGAs, such as Spartan-7 and Artix-7
  * `BUFG`, `MMCME2_BASE`
  * HDMI support: `OBUFDS`, `OSERDES2`
* **iCE40** - Lattice iCE40 FPGAs, such as iCE40 UltraPlus
  * `SB_IO`, `SB_PLL40_PAD`, `SB_SPRAM256KA`

We also infer block ram (BRAM), see [lib/memory](lib/memory).

Porting to other architectures should be straightforward.

## SystemVerilog?

We use a few simple features of SystemVerilog to make Verilog more pleasant:

* `logic` type to avoid deciding between `wire` and `reg` all the time
* `always_comb` and `always_ff` to make intent clear and catch mistakes
* `$clog2` to calculate vector widths (e.g. for addresses)
* `enum` to make finite state machines simpler to work with
* Matching names in module instances: `.clk_pix` instead of `.clk_pix(clk_pix)`

I believe these features are helpful, especially for beginners. All the SystemVerilog features used are compatible with recent versions of Verilator, Yosys, and Xilinx Vivado. However, if you need to use an older Verilog standard, you can adapt these designs without too much trouble.
