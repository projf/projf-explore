# Exploring FPGAs with Project F

Project F brings FPGAs to life with exciting and accessible [open-source](LICENSE) designs you can learn from and build on.

Learn more at [projectf.io](https://projectf.io/), follow [@WillFlux](https://twitter.com/WillFlux) for updates, and join the FPGA discussion on [1BitSquared Discord](https://1bitsquared.com/pages/chat).

## Verilog Library

The Project F Library includes handy Verilog designs for everyone. From framebuffers and video output, to division and square root, rom and ram, and even drawing shapes.

See [Library](lib/) for details or discover about the [background to the Library](https://projectf.io/posts/verilog-library-announcement/).

## Graphics

In this blog series, we explore graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. If you're new to the series, start by reading [FPGA Graphics](https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-graphics/).

## Hello

A three-part introduction to FPGA development with Verilog; currently available for two boards: the Arty A7 and Nexys Video.

* **Hello Arty**: [Designs](hello/hello-arty) - [Blog 1](https://projectf.io/posts/hello-arty-1/) - [Blog 2](https://projectf.io/posts/hello-arty-2/) - [Blog 3](https://projectf.io/posts/hello-arty-3/)
* **Hello Nexys**: [Designs](hello/hello-nexys) - [Blog 1](https://projectf.io/posts/hello-nexys-1/) - [Blog 2](https://projectf.io/posts/hello-nexys-2/)

The third part will be available for the Nexys Video soon.

## Requirements

### FPGA

Our designs seek to be vendor-neutral, but some functionality requires
support for vendor primitives. We currently support two FPGA architectures:

* **XC7** - Xilinx 7 Series FPGAs, such as Spartan-7 and Artix-7
* **iCE40** - Lattice iCE40 FPGAs, such as iCE40 UltraPlus

Porting to other architectures should be straightforward.

## SystemVerilog?

We use a few simple features of SystemVerilog to make Verilog more pleasant:

* `logic` type to avoid deciding between `wire` and `reg` all the time
* `always_comb` and `always_ff` to make intent clear and catch mistakes
* `$clog2` to calculate vector widths (e.g. for addresses)
* `enum` to make finite state machines simpler to work with
* Matching names in module instances: `.clk_pix` instead of `.clk_pix(clk_pix)`

I believe these features are helpful, especially for beginners. All the SystemVerilog features used are compatible with recent versions of Verilator, Yosys, and Xilinx Vivado. However, if you need to use an older Verilog standard, you can adapt these designs without too much trouble.
