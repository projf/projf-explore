# FPGA Graphics from Project F

Project F brings FPGAs to life with exciting and accessible [open-source](../LICENSE) designs you can learn from and build on.

Learn more at [projectf.io](https://projectf.io/), follow [@WillFlux](https://twitter.com/WillFlux) for updates, and join the FPGA discussion on [1BitSquared Discord](https://1bitsquared.com/pages/chat).

In this FPGA Graphics series, we explore graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. If you're new to the
series, start by reading [FPGA Graphics](https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-graphics/).
