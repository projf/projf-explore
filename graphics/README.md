# FPGA Graphics from Project F

In this series, we explore graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. We'll learn how displays work, race the beam with Pong, animate starfields and sprites, paint Michelangelo's David, simulate life with bitmaps, draw lines and shapes, and create smooth animation with double buffering. Along the way, you'll experience a Smörgåsbord of designs and techniques, from BRAM and finite state machines to crossing clock domains and translating C algorithms into Verilog.

If you're new to the series, start by reading [Intro to FPGA Graphics](https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-graphics/).
