# FPGA Graphics from Project F

Project F brings FPGAs to life with exciting [open-source](LICENSE) designs you can build on.  
Learn more at [projectf.io](https://projectf.io/) and follow [@WillFlux](https://twitter.com/WillFlux) for updates.

In this series, we explore graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. If you're new to the
series, start by reading [FPGA Graphics](https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-graphics/).
