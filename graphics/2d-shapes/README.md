# 2D Shapes

This folder accompanies the Project F blog post: **[2D Shapes](https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-shapes/)**. These SystemVerilog designs draw circles, rectangles, and filled shapes in a framebuffer. You can freely build on these [MIT licensed](../../LICENSE) designs for commercial and non-commercial projects. Have fun.

File layout:

* `ice40` - designs for iCEBreaker and other Lattice iCE40 boards
* `xc7-hd` - experimental designs for Nexys Video and larger Xilinx 7 Series FPGAs
* `xc7` - designs for Arty and other Xilinx 7 Series boards
* `res` - resources: colour palettes

These designs make use of modules from the [Project F library](../../lib/). Check the included iCE40 [Makefile](ice40/Makefile) or Vivado [create_project.tcl](xc7/vivado/create_project.tcl) to see the list of modules.

Included demos:

* `top_rectangles` - nested rectangle outlines
* `top_rectangles_fill` - staggered filled rectangles
* `top_triangles_fill` - three filled triangles
* `top_cube_fill` - 3D cube formed from six filled triangles
* `top_circles` - concentric circle outlines
* `top_rainbow` - rainbow drawn with filled circles
* `top_castle` - castle picture drawn from filled shapes

## iCEBreaker Build

You can build projects for [iCEBreaker](https://docs.icebreaker-fpga.org/hardware/icebreaker/) using the included [Makefile](ice40/Makefile) with [Yosys](http://www.clifford.at/yosys/), [nextpnr](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr), and [IceStorm Tools](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/). 

You can get pre-built tool binaries for Linux, Mac, and Windows from [Open Tool Forge](https://github.com/open-tool-forge/fpga-toolchain). If you want to build the tools yourself, check out [Building iCE40 FPGA Toolchain on Linux](https://projectf.io/posts/building-ice40-fpga-toolchain/).

For example, to build `top_castle`; clone the projf-explore git repo, then:

```shell
cd projf-explore/graphics/2d-shapes/ice40
make top_castle
```

After the build completes, you'll have a bin file, such as `top_castle.bin`. Use the bin file to program your board:

```shell
iceprog top_castle.bin
```

If you get the error `Can't find iCE FTDI USB device`, try running `iceprog` with `sudo`.

### Known Issue with Framebuffer

There's currently a minor issue with clearing the SPRAM before drawing: one pixel remains uncleared. I'm planning to implement clearing within the SPRAM version of the framebuffer and will then fix this issue then.

## Arty Build

To create a Vivado project for the **Digilent Arty** ([original](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty/reference-manual) or [A7-35T](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/reference-manual)); clone the projf-explore git repo, then start Vivado and run the following in the Tcl console:

```tcl
cd projf-explore/2d-shapes/xc7/vivado
source ./create_project.tcl
```

You can then build `top_castle` as you would for any Vivado project.

### Simulation

This design includes a test bench for the new drawing modules. You can run the test bench simulations from the GUI under the "Flow" menu or from the Tcl console with:

```tcl
launch_simulation
run all
```

By default the `draw_rectangle` test bench is simulated, but you can switch to another test bench, such as `draw_rectangle_fill` with:

```tcl
set fs_sim_obj [get_filesets sim_1]
set_property -name "top" -value "draw_rectangle_fill" -objects $fs_sim_obj
relaunch_sim
run all
```

### Other Xilinx 7 Series Boards

It's straightforward to adapt the project for other Xilinx 7 Series boards:

1. Create a suitable constraints file named `<board>.xdc` within the `xc7` directory
2. Make a note of your board's FPGA part, such as `xc7a35ticsg324-1L`
3. Set the board and part names in Tcl, then source the create project script:

```tcl
set board_name <board>
set fpga_part <fpga-part>
cd projf-explore/2d-shapes/xc7/vivado
source ./create_project.tcl
```

Replace `<board>` and `<fpga-part>` with the actual board and part names.

## Linting

If you have [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator) installed, you can run the linting shell script `lint.sh` to check the designs. Learn more from [Verilog Lint with Verilator](https://projectf.io/posts/verilog-lint-with-verilator/).

## SystemVerilog?

These designs use a little SystemVerilog to make Verilog more pleasant. See the [Library README](../../lib/README.md#systemverilog) for details of SV features used.
