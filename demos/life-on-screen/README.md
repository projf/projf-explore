# Life on Screen Demo

This SystemVerilog demo uses an (old) framebuffer to render Conway's Game of Life.

This demo has an associated Project F blog post: [Life on Screen](https://projectf.io/posts/life-on-screen/).

## Arty Build

To create a Vivado project for the **Digilent Arty** ([original](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty/reference-manual) or [A7-35T](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/reference-manual)); clone the projf-explore git repo, then start Vivado and run the following in the Tcl console:

```tcl
cd projf-explore/demos/life-on-screen/xc7/vivado
source ./create_project.tcl
```

You can then build `top_life` as you would for any Vivado project.
