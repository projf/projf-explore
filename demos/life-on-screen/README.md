# Life on Screen

This folder accompanies the Project F blog post: **[Life on Screen](https://projectf.io/posts/life-on-screen/)**. These SystemVerilog designs use a simple framebuffer to render Conway's Game of Life. You can freely build on these [MIT licensed](../../LICENSE) designs. Have fun.

File layout:

* `xc7` - designs for Arty and other Xilinx 7 Series boards
* `res` - resources: palettes and world seed files

This demo make uses of modules from the [Project F library](../../lib/). Check the included Vivado [create_project.tcl](xc7/vivado/create_project.tcl) to see the list of modules.

Included demos:

* `top_life` - Conway's Game of Life

## Arty Build

To create a Vivado project for the **Digilent Arty** ([original](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty/reference-manual) or [A7-35T](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/reference-manual)); clone the projf-explore git repo, then start Vivado and run the following in the Tcl console:

```tcl
cd projf-explore/demos/life-on-screen/xc7/vivado
source ./create_project.tcl
```

You can then build `top_life` as you would for any Vivado project.

### Simulation

This design includes a test bench for the life module. You can run the test bench simulation from the GUI under the "Flow" menu or from the Tcl console with:

```tcl
launch_simulation
run all
```

### Other Xilinx 7 Series Boards

It's straightforward to adapt the project for other Xilinx 7 Series boards:

1. Create a suitable constraints file named `<board>.xdc` within the `xc7` directory
2. Make a note of your board's FPGA part, such as `xc7a35ticsg324-1L`
3. Set the board and part names in Tcl, then source the create project script:

```tcl
set board_name <board>
set fpga_part <fpga-part>
cd projf-explore/demos/life-on-screen/xc7/vivado
source ./create_project.tcl
```

Replace `<board>` and `<fpga-part>` with the actual board and part names.

## Linting

If you have [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator) installed, you can run the linting shell script `lint.sh` to check the designs. Learn more from [Verilog Lint with Verilator](https://projectf.io/posts/verilog-lint-with-verilator/).

## SystemVerilog?

These designs use a little SystemVerilog to make Verilog more pleasant. See the [Library README](../../lib/README.md#systemverilog) for details of SV features used.
