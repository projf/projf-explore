# Ad Astra

These SystemVerilog examples use starfields and hardware sprites to build up a simple greetings demo. The final demo is in file `top_greet.sv`.

I created Ad Astra in 2018; it was my first FPGA demo, but I didn't release it at a party (for one thing it has no music).
This version remains similar to the original source, but has some minor updates to work with the Project F Verilog library.

This demo has an associated Project F blog post: [Ad Astra](https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-ad-astra/).

Included demos:

* `top_lfsr` - simple background using a linear feedback register (LFSR)
* `top_starfield` - layered starfields using multiple LFSRs
* `top_space_f` - 'F' character overlaid on starfield using sprite
* `top_hello_en` - multiple sprites spell "Hello" on starfield
* `top_hello_jp` - multiple sprites spell "こんにちは" on starfield
* `top_greet_v1` - greetings to open source hardware projects
* `top_greet` - greetings to open source hardware projects with copper colours

## Arty Build

To create a Vivado project for the Digilent Arty ([original](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty/reference-manual) or [A7-35T](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/reference-manual)); clone the projf-explore git repo, then start Vivado and run the following in the Tcl console:

```tcl
cd projf-explore/demos/ad-astra/xc7/vivado
source ./create_project.tcl
```

You can then build `top_greet`, `top_hello_jp` etc. as you would for any Vivado project.
